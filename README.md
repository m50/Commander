## A journey in learning C#

This is from the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmvcAzHpsk8) from Les Jackson
on YouTube, as a beginners course into an MVC RestAPI with .Net Core.

Some of this is also my own stuff added ontop of it.

This isn't meant to be used in any way, it was just a learning exercise to learn
about C# and .Net core for building APIs.

I used C# 10 years ago, but a lot has changed, and .Net core is a whole new thing,
so this was good to refresh my C# knowledge and to learn a bit about creating APIs
in .Net Core.
