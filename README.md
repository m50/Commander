## A journey in learning C#

This is from the videos by [Les Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIMRGVXufHT69s1uaHHYJIA)
on YouTube, as a beginners course into MVC RestAPIs with .Net Core.

Some of this is also my own stuff added ontop of it. Additionally, I don't have
the ability to use SqlServer, so I went with Sqlite instead, ideally though, I'd
use something like Postgresql if I were planning to actually deploy.

This isn't meant to be used in any way, it was just a learning exercise to learn
about C# and .Net core for building APIs.

I used C# 10 years ago, but a lot has changed, and .Net core is a whole new thing,
so this was good to refresh my C# knowledge and to learn a bit about creating APIs
in .Net Core.
